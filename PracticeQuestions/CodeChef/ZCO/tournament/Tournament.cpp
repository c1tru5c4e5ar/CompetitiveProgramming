/*

N teams participate in a league cricket tournament on Mars, where each pair of distinct teams plays each other exactly once. Thus, there are a total of (N Ã— (N-1))/2 matches. An expert has assigned a strength to each team, a positive integer. Strangely, the Martian crowds love one-sided matches and the advertising revenue earned from a match is the absolute value of the difference between the strengths of the two matches. Given the strengths of the N teams, find the total advertising revenue earned from all the matches.

For example, suppose N is 4 and the team strengths for teams 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 3, 10, 3, and 5 respectively. Then the advertising revenues from the 6 matches are as follows:

Match 	Team A 	Team B 	Ad revenue
1 	1 	2 	7
2 	1 	3 	0
3 	1 	4 	2
4 	2 	3 	7
5 	2 	4 	5
6 	3 	4 	2


Thus the total advertising revenue is 23.
